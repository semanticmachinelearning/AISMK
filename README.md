# AISMK
AISMK (AI Semantic Microservice Knowledge) framework 

The start file is the inputlearning.ipynb (suggest to use Jupter notebook)

The interface.ipynb file will invoke agent.py to coordinate the microservice provisioning for different tasks

The dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt file

The transformers may needs extra settings of your environment such as GTP-neo

More information can be viewed in the submitted research paper (in process of review): 
Towards Human-level AI Through Self-supervised Knowledge Learning and Semantic AI Microservices Engineering (Towards_Human_level_AI_knowledge_final.pdf)
